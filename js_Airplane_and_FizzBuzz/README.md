Process for learning a new language
(not in order)

1.writing out what i know in the language i'm most fluent in

2.converting all of those things into the new language

3.run small tests to figure out what does what inside the terminal, console or equivalent

4.look at other examples of completed code and break them down to understand what is happening and what lines and methods do what

5.look up as much syntax as possible

6.retry previous tasks in a new language as i will already understand the logic of them

7.ask other people who may know more than me for help if i get stuck

8.watch youtube tutorials and videos

9.Find a Cheat Sheet to refer to when first starting out
